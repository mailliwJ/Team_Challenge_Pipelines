# Team Challenge: Pipelines

### Overview

This repository is the solution to a team challenge focused on leveraging machine learning pipelines across various scenarios. The aim is to automate and streamline workflows and promote best practices in data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, all within a scalable and reproducible setup.

### Objectives

1. Workflow Automation with Pipelines to ensure that each stage of the process is reproducible and efficient.
   
2. Implementation of Estimators:
   * Supervised Learning: 
     * Regression models with non-Gaussian distributed targets.
     * Balanced and imbalanced classification models.
   * Unsupervised Learning: use of unsupervised models for tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Handling Categorical Variables with `OneHotEncoder` to minimize errors caused by mismatches in categorical values between training, validation, and testing datasets.
   
4. Hyperparameter Tuning with `GridSearchCV`.
   
5. Cross-Validation and its advantages in the context of pipelines.
